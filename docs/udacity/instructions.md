## Building the Flashcard Quizzer CLI Application

### 1. Project Structure

You have been provided with a project repository containing the following skeleton. Do not delete the folder structure, as your AI agent needs this organization to separate concerns effectively.

- `main.py`: Currently empty. This will be your entry point.
- `data/`: Place your sample JSON files here.
- `utils/`: For helper modules (you will generate file_handler.py here).
- `tests/`: Currently empty. You will direct the AI to fill this with pytest cases.
- `docs/`: Contains templates for your "AI Interaction Log." **You must update this log as you work**.
- `.claude/` or `.env`: Configuration files for your AI tools.

### 2. Implementation Milestones

You must guide your AI agent through these distinct development phases.

**Phase 1: Data Layer & Validation**

Create a system to load and validate flashcard data.

- Requirement: The app must support JSON input in two formats:
  - Array Format: A simple list of objects `[{"front": "...", "back": "..."}]`.
  - Object Format: A wrapper object `{"cards": [...]}`.
- Error Handling: If the JSON is malformed or missing fields, the app must catch the error and print a friendly message (no raw Python tracebacks).

**Phase 2: Core Logic & Design Patterns**

Objective: Implement the quiz engine using the Strategy Pattern.

- The Logic: You need three distinct ways to serve questions:
  - SequentialMode: Order 1, 2, 3...
  - RandomMode: Shuffled order.
  - AdaptiveMode: Prioritize cards the user gets wrong.
- Implement a QuizMode abstract base class. Then create three classes that inherit from it. Use a Factory Pattern to select the correct mode based on user input."

**Phase 3: The CLI & Interaction**

Finally, build the user interface.

- Requirements:
  - Use argparse to handle flags like -f (file), -m (mode), and --stats.
  - Display text colors (Green for correct, Red for incorrect).
  - Allow the user to type "exit" or press Ctrl+C to quit gracefully without errors.

### 3. Testing Requirements

You are responsible for the quality of the AI's code. You must direct the AI to write a comprehensive test suite. Your final submission must pass the following test scenarios:

**A. Data Loader Tests (test_flashcard_loader.py)**

- test_load_valid_flashcards_array: Does it load a list correctly?
- test_load_invalid_json: Does it gracefully handle bad syntax?
- test_load_missing_required_field: Does it reject cards without a "Back"?

**B. Quiz Logic Tests (test_quiz_modes.py)**

- test_quiz_mode_factory: Does the factory return the correct class object?
- test_adaptive_mode_behavior: Does it actually repeat incorrect questions?

**C. Integration Tests (test_integration.py)**

- test_full_session: Simulate a user answering 3 questions and checking the final stats calculation.

How to verify: Run the full suite in your terminal:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Run the full suite in your terminal for report:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

**Target**: >80% code coverage.

## 4. Definition of Done

Your project is complete when:

1. You can run python main.py -m adaptive -f data/python_basics.json and play a full game.
2. The code uses the Strategy and Factory patterns (checked by inspecting quiz_engine.py).
3. All tests pass, and flake8 reports no linting errors.
4. Your docs/ai_edit_log.md contains at least 5 examples of prompts you improved or logic you corrected.

## 5. Submission Checklist

Submit your GitHub repository link containing:

- **Complete codebase** with all source files, tests, and documentation
- **Completed** `ai_edit_log.md` with at least 5 detailed AI interaction examples
- **Final project report** using the provided template (1000-1500 words)
- **Updated README.md** with current setup instructions and feature descriptions
- **Test coverage report** demonstrating >80% coverage
- **Code quality verification** (all linting tools should pass without errors)

> **Tip**: If the AI gets stuck or writes bad code, do not rewrite the Python yourself. Rewrite your prompt.
